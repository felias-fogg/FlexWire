CHANGELOG for FlexWire
V1.1.0
  - Added: If running on AVR architecture and AVR_OPTIMZATION is not
    set to 0 in the header file, then direct port manipulation is used
    to work on the I2C bus. That allows up to around 200 kHz bus
    frequency.
  - In this case, the default frequency is around 100 kHz. If you use
    setClock, then <= 10000 set something around 10 kHz, <= 30000 sets
    a clock of around 30 kHz, <= 200000 set something around 100 kHz,
    and anything above will give a bus speed of around 250 kHz. All on
    16 MHz MCUs.
  - If the AVR_OPTIMIZATION is not used, then the bus frequency is
    around 50 kHz on 16MHz AVR chip.

V1.0.1 (14.12.2023)
  - Fix: in bma020FlexWire "#include <FlexI2CMaster.h>" removed
  - Fix: added "required-libraries" to workflow

V1.0.0 (14.12.2023)
  - Fix: Set received bytes to zero in call to requestFrom when I2C
    device NAKs on the device address
  - Changed DELAY to I2C_DELAY
  - Added Atomic Blocks for level changes, provided the AVR
    architecture is used
  - Added new example: multi_i2c
  - Added new method: setPins
  - removed the requestFrom call with internal registers (not
    documented, but present in the Wire lib)
  - Added the possibility to instantiate class without pin arguments;
    these have to be set later using setPins
  - removed i2c_start_wait

V0.0.1 (30.11.2023)
  - initial commit, merging SlowSoftI2CMaster and SlowSoftMaster
  - contains already Wire.h in the library folder
