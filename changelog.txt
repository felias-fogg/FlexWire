CHANGELOG for FlexWire

V1.0.0 (14.12.2023)
  - Fix: Set received bytes to zero in call to requestFrom when I2C
    device NAKs on the device address
  - Changed DELAY to I2C_DELAY
  - Added Atomic Blocks for level changes, provided the AVR
    architecture is used
  - Added new example: multi_i2c
  - Added new method: setPins
  - removed the requestFrom call with internal registers (not
    documented, but present in the Wire lib)
  - Added the possibility to instantiate class without pin arguments;
    these have to be set later using setPins
  - removed i2c_start_wait

V0.0.1 (30.11.2023)
  - initial commit, merging SlowSoftI2CMaster and SlowSoftMaster
  - contains already Wire.h in the library folder
